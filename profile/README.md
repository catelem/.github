## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Catalyst Elemental LLC ('Catel') exists as a privately chartered company under the ownership of Catalyst Foundation LP with the threefold mission:
* To discover and develop **therapeutics for spontaneous fatal insomnia (sFI)** treating, curing, or modifying the course of the disease to maximize the remaining cognitive function of patients, and, secondarily, other prion diseases.
* **To boldly go where no man has gone before.** We perform basic research, advancing the state of the art in medicine and everywhere we touch, finishing with whole lifecycle implementation. We discover truth, wherever it may be.
* **To perform *in vivo* transmutation of elements** or minimally the ability to "knock out" affected genes down to the single-nucleotide scale and remove infected tissues reflected in our name and our founder's vision, we place a third goal: to find approaches more likely to generate greater benefit, applying software design principles such as modularity and portability to medical science.

The guiding principle given by our founder, Chairman and Executive Director of the Catalyst Foundation and Research Lead Scientist of Catel is, "Elegance, Ã©lan, in all things. All the world is a stage and all life an art," which we take to mean:
**Ars gratia artis**. We do not work for the money, although it is good; we do work for the Nobel, which is not a thing we should;  we do not work for equity, RSU, or ISO. *Our ideal is to provide a home and funding for every S-tier researcher* whose existing research areas align with or can be made to align with the first point of our mission.
